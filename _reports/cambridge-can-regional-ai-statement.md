Cambridge’s AI ecosystem brings together world-leading research, industry innovation, and public sector implementation to deliver real-world impact for citizens while strengthening the UK’s global competitive position.

We are home to over 5,000 innovation-driven companies, including 120 AI powered companies who employ 13,000 people and have a combined turnover of £6bn, 36 research parks, five hospital trusts, two universities, and a thriving startup and investor community. The region can lead the way in bringing the UK’s vision for AI to life.

By working collaboratively across Cambridge’s AI ecosystem, we can strengthen the UK’s AI capabilities while ensuring the benefits spread to all parts of the nation. We have the academic expertise, the business community, and the civic infrastructure to be a global destination for AI innovation.

This regional AI Statement highlights the breadth AI activity happening across the Cambridgeshire region and represents our commitment to ensure AI development is responsible, inclusive, sustainable, and an engine for innovation that serves the public good.

We aim to foster connected communities by building AI capabilities across our region, widening access to the tools, knowledge, and know how which can focuse on delivering meaningful improvements to people’s lives.
