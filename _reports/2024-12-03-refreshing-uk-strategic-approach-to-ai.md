## Impact and Next Steps

The UK has strategic strengths in research and human capital that could be deployed to bridge the gaps between research and practice affecting how, where, and for whose benefit AI innovations develop. The report calls for innovative approaches to open policy development that embed stakeholder engagement across the policy lifecycle.

By supporting those on the frontlines of innovating with AI to deliver public benefit, the UK can generate a productivity flywheel that scales AI innovation while closing the gap between technological progress and real-world benefit.
