This policy brief addresses how to bridge the gap between AI’s technical capabilities and their use to deliver real-world public benefit. The report highlights the need to focus on practical barriers to delivering AI-enabled solutions to real-world challenges as part of policy design and implementation.

## Key Findings

* AI technologies and policy development are not adequately addressing social needs
* Growing gap exists between AI’s technical capabilities and real-world benefit delivery
* Policy must balance ‘supply’ of AI innovation with interventions centered on ‘demand’
* UK’s research strengths can be deployed to build AI solutions for real-world challenges
* Public dialogues provide clear direction for what people want from AI technologies

## Recommendations

* Center public interests in AI development
* Strengthen governance frameworks that steward AI towards public benefit
* Build public infrastructure for innovation
* Grow UK’s domestic AI base to deliver real benefits for citizens
* Focus on practical barriers to implementing AI in areas of public interest

## Impact and Next Steps

The UK has strategic strengths in research and human capital that could be deployed to bridge the gaps between research and practice affecting how, where, and for whose benefit AI innovations develop. The report calls for innovative approaches to open policy development that embed stakeholder engagement across the policy lifecycle.

By supporting those on the frontlines of innovating with AI to deliver public benefit, the UK can generate a productivity flywheel that scales AI innovation while closing the gap between technological progress and real-world benefit.
