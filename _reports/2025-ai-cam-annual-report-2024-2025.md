  By connecting the University of Cambridge’s world-leading research with
  real-world challenges ranging from local government to global sustainable
  development, ai@cam is demonstrating how universities can drive a new wave of
  AI innovation that delivers public benefit. 


  In its second year, the programme engaged over 3,000 people across all six Schools, brought together researchers from 58 departments, generated more than £9M in funding proposals, and established Cambridge as a trusted voice in national AI policy.
