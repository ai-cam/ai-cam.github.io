This policy brief addresses three key questions regarding the UK's approach to generative AI development and governance.

## Key Research Questions

1. What policy infrastructure and social capacity does the UK need to lead and manage deployment of responsible generative AI (over the long term)?
2. What national capability does the UK need for large-scale AI systems in the short- and medium-term?
3. What governance capacity does the UK need to deal with fast moving technologies, in which large uncertainties are a feature, not a bug?
