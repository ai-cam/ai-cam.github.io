This report presents a series of case studies examining access to data for research, highlighting crucial design considerations for the UK’s National Data Library and the need for digital infrastructure that connects data, researchers, and resources.

## Key Case Studies

The report features innovative uses of data for research across critical areas:

* **Cancer Research Data Challenges**

  \- Dr Mireia Crispin examines the data barriers in cancer research
* **Social Media Research Evolution**

  \- Dr Amy Orben explores changes in social media research access
* **Environmental Conservation**

  \- Dr Sadiq Jaffer and Dr Alec Christie demonstrate data’s role in planet conservation
* **Polar Research Challenges**

  \- Dr Scott Hosking investigates data barriers in Polar research
* **COVID-19 Data Insights**

  \- Professor Stefan Scholtes shares lessons from pandemic data use
* **Supply Chain Analysis**

  \- Professor Vasco Carvalho explores supply chain data complexities

## Key Findings

The case studies revealed several critical aspects of data access and use:

* Researchers face significant barriers in accessing data across multiple disciplines
* Current infrastructure needs improvement to better connect data, researchers, and resources
* Policy development is needed to address data access challenges
* Cross-disciplinary collaboration is essential for effective data sharing
* Digital infrastructure must support both data access and responsible use

## Recommendations

Based on researcher experiences, the report recommends:

* Develop robust frameworks for data sharing in research
* Create infrastructure that connects data, researchers, and enabling resources
* Address discipline-specific data access challenges
* Ensure policy development is informed by researcher experiences
* Build systems that support both access and responsible data use

## Impact for the National Data Library

The findings from these case studies provide crucial insights for the development of the UK’s National Data Library, highlighting the need for infrastructure that supports both access to and responsible use of research data.
