### Abstract

By connecting the University of Cambridge’s world-leading research with real-world challenges ranging from local government to global sustainable development, ai@cam is demonstrating how universities can drive a new wave of AI innovation that delivers public benefit. In its second year, the programme engaged over 3,000 people across all six Schools, brought together researchers from 58 departments and established Cambridge as a trusted voice in national AI policy.



## Executive Summary

ai@cam is the University of Cambridge’s mission to ensure AI serves science, citizens, and society. In its second year, the initiative has expanded its reach across the University and beyond, advancing interdisciplinary research, training over 1,500 researchers, shaping national policy, and building global partnerships that translate AI innovation into real-world benefit.

## Key Achievements 2024–25
