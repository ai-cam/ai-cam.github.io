  The report is a collaboration between the Minderoo Centre for Technology and
  Democracy, the Bennett Institute for Public Policy, and ai@cam which argues
  that the unregulated use of Generative AI in the UK economy will not
  necessarily lead to economic growth, and risks damaging the UKâ€™s thriving
  creative sector.
