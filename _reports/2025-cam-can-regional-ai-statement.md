## Cam Can: Regional AI statement

Cambridge's AI ecosystem brings together world-leading research, industry innovation, and public sector implementation to deliver real-world impact for citizens while strengthening the UK's global competitive position.

We are home to over 5,000 innovation-driven companies, including 120 AI powered companies who employ 13,000 people and have a combined turnover of Â£6bn, 36 research parks, five hospital trusts, two universities, and a thriving startup and investor community. The region can lead the way in bringing the UK's vision for AI to life.

By working collaboratively across Cambridge's AI ecosystem, we can strengthen the UK's AI capabilities while ensuring the benefits spread to all parts of the nation. We have the academic expertise, the business community, and the civic infrastructure to be a global destination for AI innovation.
