ai@cam is launching a new initiative to support administrative staff across the University to use AI to enhance University operations.

The "AI for University Ops" programme will provide funding, technical support, and community building to help administrative teams implement AI solutions that address their operational challenges.

Introducing the initiative, Jess Montgomery, Director of ai@cam and Accelerate Science said: "AI offers an opportunity to increase the efficiency of our administrative work, while allowing staff to focus on activities that directly support our academic mission. We’ve already seen the benefits of deploying AI for our research. This new initiative will extend these benefits to our professional services functions.”

Professor Neil Lawrence, Chair of ai@cam, said: "We've seen tremendous enthusiasm for experimenting with AI across many areas of University administration. This programme will help capitalise on this interest by supporting staff to identify opportunities for efficiency gains, share insights on 'what works' across departments, and find support for developing and scaling technical solutions."

The programme will offer technical support and micro-grants for promising administrative AI projects, while also documenting existing successful use cases and creating a community of practice that helps scale successful applications.

Professional services teams from across the University are invited to submit expressions of interest in engaging with this initiative by 09:00, 28 May 2025. This initial phase will help identify existing AI implementations and gather input on administrative challenges that could benefit from AI solutions. A launch workshop will follow in June, bringing together participants to share examples, develop collaborations, and network with colleagues facing similar challenges.

If you would like to express interest in this initiative, please fill out the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBFooODF_Ifbl2LUiXvyFMeAP1tqGf7qFk06qbO0ZIEuqKCw/viewform?usp=sharing) by 09:00 on 28 May 2025.

#### Q&A session

We will be holding an information and **Q&A session on 2 May, 11:00 - 12:00**, please sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfnuRmYWlfHhAffBXt9cFWLWAUFzoIhzj_xx74tZiI-VhsBYA/viewform?usp=header) for the Zoom link.

#### **Frequently Asked Questions**

***What is AI for University Ops?***\
The "AI for University Ops" programme provides a lightweight, integrated approach to supporting administrative AI adoption across the University. Building on our successful approach to enabling AI adoption in research, this programme will provide support for promising AI projects in administration, create opportunities to share successful practices, and build a community of practitioners.\
\
***How does the programme work?***\
The programme operates in three phases:

* Phase 1: Kick-off: We’re launching an Expression of Interest that invites PSS staff to suggest projects or applications they would be interested in developing and begins to log existing use cases.
* Phase 2: Project proposals: On 12 June we’ll host a launch workshop that invites participants in the EOI to share example use cases, develop collaborations, and network. This will be followed by a call for projects that invites proposals for further work.
* Phase 3: Implementation: Selected projects receive support and engage in community building activities. 

***What kinds of administrative challenges can be addressed?***\
The first phase of this programme is challenge-agnostic, supporting any professional services function that could benefit from AI augmentation. Examples might include managing postgraduate admissions correspondence, streamlining document processing or routine administration such as note-taking.\
\
***How much funding is available per project?***\
This EOI is not an application for funding, though we anticipate that funding might be a component of the call for projects that follows. We’ll develop the specifics of our support offer based on feedback from our EOI. Our starting point is that we might offer small grants up to £10,000, depending on scope and potential impact. These grants are intended to cover implementation costs, such as potential software subscriptions or resource for data collection. They are not intended to cover staff time.\
\
***Who can engage with this EOI?***\
The programme is open to professional services and technical staff across all university departments. This first phase invites EOIs from all University staff with an interest in applying AI for University operations. In the next phase of work, we anticipate that project applications can come from individuals or teams; the lead should be a member of the Professional Services Staff. \
\
***What if we're already using AI tools in our department?***\
We encourage you to share your existing implementations through the Expression of Interest form. This helps build our knowledge repository. Existing implementers may also be able to apply for funding to expand or enhance their current solutions.\
\
***What technical expertise is required?***\
No prior AI expertise is necessary, but a willingness to be proactive in learning how to implement these technologies is vital. The programme will provide technical support through Accelerate Science’s AI Clinic. The ideal applicant has a clear administrative challenge and willingness to learn, rather than existing technical skills.\
\
***How will ethical concerns be addressed?***\
At this stage of the programme, we are inviting expressions of interest in developing project ideas. When we are looking for projects or inviting applications for project support, we expect that each implementation should include consideration of ethical implications, particularly for projects handling sensitive data. We want to embed responsible AI principles in the use of AI in the University. The programme will encourage critical reflection on the use of AI as projects progress.\
\
***What happens after the funding period?***\
Successful implementations will be documented and shared through the digital hub and showcase event. A key aim of successful projects should be the mainstreaming of their AI tools.\
\
***How will success be measured?***\
When we invite project proposals, we will ask projects to define their success metrics as part of the application process. These might include time saved, error reduction, satisfaction ratings, or other quantifiable benefits. The programme's overall success will be measured by number of implementations, cross-departmental adoption, and documented efficiency gains.

***How can I apply?***\
Please fill in the expression of interest form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBFooODF_Ifbl2LUiXvyFMeAP1tqGf7qFk06qbO0ZIEuqKCw/viewform?usp=sharing) by 09:00, 28 May 2025. You will need to be logged in to your @cam.ac.uk account to access the form.
