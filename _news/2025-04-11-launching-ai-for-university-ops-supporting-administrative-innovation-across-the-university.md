ai@cam is launching a new initiative to support administrative staff across the University to use AI to enhance University operations.

The "AI for University Ops" programme will provide funding, technical support, and community building to help administrative teams implement AI solutions that address their operational challenges.

Introducing the initiative, Jess Montgomery, Director of ai@cam and Accelerate Science said: "AI offers an opportunity to increase the efficiency of our administrative work, while allowing staff to focus on activities that directly support our academic mission. We’ve already seen the benefits of deploying AI for our research. This new initiative will extend these benefits to our professional services functions.”

Professor Neil Lawrence, Chair of ai@cam, said: "We've seen tremendous enthusiasm for experimenting with AI across many areas of University administration. This programme will help capitalise on this interest by supporting staff to identify opportunities for efficiency gains, share insights on 'what works' across departments, and find support for developing and scaling technical solutions."

The programme will offer technical support and micro-grants for promising administrative AI projects, while also documenting existing successful use cases and creating a community of practice that helps scale successful applications.

Professional services teams from across the University are invited to submit expressions of interest in engaging with this initiative by 09:00, 28 May 2025. This initial phase will help identify existing AI implementations and gather input on administrative challenges that could benefit from AI solutions. A launch workshop will follow on 12 June, bringing together participants to share examples, develop collaborations, and network with colleagues facing similar challenges.
