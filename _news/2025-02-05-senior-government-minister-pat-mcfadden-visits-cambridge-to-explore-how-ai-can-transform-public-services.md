The University welcomed the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Rt Hon Pat McFadden MP, to tour the DAWN supercomputer and discuss the ways in which AI can transform public services and healthcare.  

Mr McFadden was welcomed by Vice-Chancellor, Professor Deborah Prentice, to DAWN, the fastest supercomputer in Europe, where he was given a tour of the cutting-edge facility by Dr Paul Calleja, Director of the University’s Research Computing Services. He also spoke with engineers who work on the supercomputer, with industry partners at Dell, and the UK's Atomic Energy Authority. 

Professor Prentice said: "I was very pleased to welcome the Minister to Cambridge to explore the rapidly-developing ways in which the University's research, and DAWN-powered AI, are driving improvements in everyday life. From improving diagnostics to speeding up planning applications, Cambridge AI research is producing positive impact in people's lives."

Following the tour of DAWN, the Minister visited Cambridge University Hospitals (CUH) to witness firsthand the practical applications of DAWN-powered AI. Mr McFadden was shown two use cases of this technology in healthcare. 

Professor Fleur Kilburn-Toppin discussed the potential for AI in breast cancer diagnosis through the EDITH trial, a multicentre mammography study assessing AI’s role in enhancing cancer detection. This discussion coincided with the Government’s launch of the EDITH trial to tackle breast cancer on World Cancer Day. 

The second case study was presented in the Department of Radiology, by Dr Suthesh Sivapalaratnam and Professor Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb, who spoke to the Minister about the Blood Counts AI project which harnesses AI to revolutionise disease detection. The project provides an early warning system for infectious diseases, improving public health responses across the NHS. 

The day concluded with a roundtable conversation with academics and clinicians around how the UK can harness the potential of AI to improve public services across various areas, ranging from healthcare to productivity and local government services.  

This visit underscored the University's pivotal role in harnessing AI for societal benefit and the potential for University research in cutting-edge technology to help public service transformation. 

Mr McFadden said: "AI has the power to transform our public services, and the DAWN supercomputer is an excellent example of cutting-edge work being done right here in the UK, with an amazing partnership between Cambridge University and Addenbrooke's Hospital, improving medical diagnosis for patients.

"What's happening in Cambridge is really exciting, but we are only at the foothills of this technology and its potential to improve people's lives. Which is why we are putting innovation at the forefront of our Plan for Change."
