A new Cambridge-led initiative will offer local councillors the chance to shape how artificial intelligence is applied in local government.

A first-of-its-kind “challenge fair” will flip the usual academic conference model by putting council staff – not researchers – at the centre of the conversation about how AI can improve public services.

The event, hosted by ai@cam with Cambridgeshire councils on the 24 November, will convene local authority staff from Cambridgeshire, Peterborough and Greater Manchester with University of Cambridge researchers. Rather than presenting their own research, academics will hear directly from council staff as they set out their most significant operational challenges and explore where artificial intelligence could support. 

As councils increasingly look to artificial intelligence to improve services and meet rising demand, the fair will connect the frontline knowledge of local authorities with Cambridge’s research expertise. By spotlighting real pressures faced by councils – from social care paperwork to planning backlogs and transport congestion – the fair creates a two-way marketplace, designed to explore how AI could provide practical solutions.

“We’re bringing together the people who understand public service challenges with the researchers who can help solve them,” said Jessica Montgomery, Director of ai@cam. “This approach ensures AI innovations actually work in the real world and deliver genuine benefits for communities.”

“The best innovations come from understanding real problems on the ground,” said Liz Watts, Chief Executive of South Cambridgeshire District Council. “This initiative lets us share the challenges our teams face daily with researchers who might have the technical solutions – it’s the kind of partnership that can deliver real benefit for residents.”

Partnerships emerging from the fair will be eligible to apply for follow-on support through ai@cam’s forthcoming AI for Local Government Accelerator programme, which will provide funding and incubator-style backing for projects later in the year. ai@cam are particularly encouraging challenges that could benefit multiple councils, with the potential for solutions to be scaled and shared across regions.

The AI in Local Government Challenge Fair takes place from 13:00–17:00 on Monday 24 November and will include lunch and networking opportunities. 

Council staff and University of Cambridge researchers can apply to take part via the [application form](https://forms.gle/GKN5DnmLfyf5ru3X9) by 17:00 on 14 November.
