Researchers at the University of Cambridge are invited to apply for a new six-month accelerator designed to fast-track AI research into working prototypes that deliver real-world benefits.

The AI-deas Sprint Programme, launched by ai@cam, offers up to £25,000 in funding alongside hands-on technical support, expert mentoring, and opportunities to engage with external partners and user communities. 

The programme builds on the success of the AI-deas initiative and will support bold, interdisciplinary projects across seven key areas where AI can have real-world impact: mental health and brain science, climate and environmental resilience, women’s health and fertility, cultural heritage, education and assessment, language equity, and connected cities. Each domain offers the opportunity to translate cutting-edge research into practical tools and technologies that address pressing societal needs.

“The AI-deas Sprint Programme is about moving beyond asking ‘what if’ to demonstrating ‘here’s how,’” said Jess Montgomery, Director of ai@cam. “We’re giving researchers the support they need to transform their ideas into prototypes that can immediately start making a positive difference.”

Running from November 2025 to April 2026, the sprint will guide selected teams through challenge definition, rapid development, and prototype testing. A mid-sprint networking session will connect participants with potential partners, while a final Demo Day will provide the opportunity to showcase prototypes to funders and collaborators.

Applications must be submitted by 17:00 on Friday 10 October 2025, with all teams invited to present their proposals at a pitch presentation session on Wednesday 29 October from 13:00 - 17:00. Prospective applicants are encouraged to attend an information session from 14:30 - 15:30 on Friday 3 October to learn more about the programme and how to apply.
