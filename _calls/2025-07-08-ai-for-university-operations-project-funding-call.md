    Universities face growing administrative complexity while working to support
    their core academic mission. AI offers a capacity-building tool to support
    more efficient administrative processes while freeing up time for complex
    work requiring judgment, creativity, and human collaboration. ai@cam’s AI
    for Operations programme aims to support this shift, enabling improved
    student and researcher experiences through streamlined and responsive
    administrative systems.


    Our previous call for expressions of interest in AI for Operations showed there is huge interest from professional services staff in experimenting with AI across diverse applications - from communications teams using AI for content generation to finance departments exploring contract analysis. Many staff want to upskill in this area, but lack the resources to identify and implement AI tools that could benefit their work. In response, ai@cam is launching the AI for Operations project funding call. This initiative will provide funding and technical support for administrative teams ready to deploy AI solutions that address real operational challenges.


    Projects supported by this call will receive up to £10,000 to carry out 6 month project sprints, during which time teams will have access to technical support via an AI Clinic, and community engagement activities to develop shared case studies and best practices. Showcase events will share project outcomes with the wider community.

      content: |-
        The project proposal will be evaluated based on the following criteria: 

        * Business need
        * Impact on operational processes
        * Achievable delivery within the allocated time frame
        * Approach to risk management and ethical considerations
    - heading: How much funding is available per project and what will the funding
        cover?
      content: Small grants of up to £10,000 will be available, depending on scope and
        potential impact of each project. These grants are intended to cover
        implementation costs, such as potential software subscriptions or
        resources for data collection. They are not intended to cover staff
        time.
    - heading: What support will grant awardees receive?
      content: >-
        **Funding:** Grants of up to £10,000 each will be awarded to project
        teams to cover implementation costs such as software subscriptions and
        resources for data collection (not staff time).


        **Technical support**: Monthly drop-in AI clinic sessions will be arranged with Accelerate Science Machine Learning Engineers who will provide hands-on guidance throughout your project.


        **Community:** Opportunities to collaborate with other project teams through peer learning roundtables will be organised. An AI Community of Practice will act as a digital hub for documentation on existing case studies. 


        **Showcase:** Project teams will present their successful implementations to the wider University community and contribute to building institutional knowledge.
