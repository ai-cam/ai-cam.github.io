    Universities face growing administrative complexity while working to support
    their core academic mission. AI offers a capacity-building tool to support
    more efficient administrative processes while freeing up time for complex
    work requiring judgment, creativity, and human collaboration. ai@cam’s AI
    for Operations programme aims to support this shift, enabling improved
    student and researcher experiences through streamlined and responsive
    administrative systems.


    Our previous call for expressions of interest in AI for Operations showed there is huge interest from professional services staff in experimenting with AI across diverse applications - from communications teams using AI for content generation to finance departments exploring contract analysis. Many staff want to upskill in this area, but lack the resources to identify and implement AI tools that could benefit their work. In response, ai@cam is launching the AI for Operations project funding call. This initiative will provide funding and technical support for administrative teams ready to deploy AI solutions that address real operational challenges.


    Projects supported by this call will receive up to £10,000 to carry out 6 month project sprints, during which time teams will have access to technical support via an AI Clinic, and community engagement activities to develop shared case studies and best practices. Showcase events will share project outcomes with the wider community.
