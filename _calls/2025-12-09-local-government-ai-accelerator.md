    New funding scheme supports collaborative research projects between
    University of Cambridge and local authorities.


    The University of Cambridge is launching a new funding scheme to support collaborative AI research and development projects with local government partners. The ai@cam Local Government AI Accelerator will provide grants of up to £25,000 for proof-of-concept projects that address shared challenges across multiple councils.


    The fund represents a new approach to AI innovation in public services, connecting academic expertise with real-world operational needs. Projects must demonstrate clear buy-in from at least one local authority partner, be led by a University of Cambridge researcher eligible to hold funding, and deliver results within 12 months.


    The initiative builds on ai@cam's work with local government partners across Cambridgeshire and beyond. Early AI adopters in local government are already demonstrating the technology's potential in areas like social care, planning consultation analysis, and infrastructure maintenance. This collaboration aims to support councils in identifying promising AI applications and developing appropriate solutions.

  heading: How the fund works
  content: >-
    Funded projects will receive up to £25,000 for 9-12 months of
    proof-of-concept development, with ongoing support through monthly community
    of practice sessions and technical support clinics with ai@cam's machine
    learning engineers. A final showcase will document lessons learned and
    explore pathways for scaling successful solutions across the sector.


    Proposals must be submitted by 16.00 on Friday 13 February and should demonstrate clear partnership with at least one local authority.


    To apply, we ask for some basic project information, a two page project proposal, and supporting documents to demonstrate local authority support and headline spending plans. 


    We encourage all applicants to read the FAQs below before applying. If you have any further questions  around eligibility or the application process, please contact Jess Montgomery (jkm40@cam.ac.uk.)

  heading: Frequently Asked Questions
  faqs:
    - heading: What is the ai@cam Local Government Innovation Fund?
      content: The fund provides grants of up to £25,000 to support collaborative
        research projects between University of Cambridge researchers and local
        government partners. It aims to develop proof-of-concept AI solutions
        that address challenges in public service delivery in local authorities.
    - heading: Who can apply for funding?
      content: >-
        Applications must be led by a researcher based at the University of
        Cambridge and demonstrate clear buy-in from at least one local authority
        partner. We encourage applications that address challenges shared across
        multiple councils, as these have greater potential for sector-wide
        impact.


        We have already heard from some local authority partners about areas where they would welcome support during a workshop on 24 November 2025. You can read more about these areas on our recent [ai@cam blog.](https://www.ai.cam.ac.uk/blog/what-local-government-needs-from-ai-learning-from-practice-in-our-ai-for-local-government-accelerator)
    - heading: What level of council involvement is required?
      content: Projects must have engagement with local authority partners throughout
        development, not just at the application stage. This means ongoing
        engagement with council staff who understand the operational context and
        can help ensure the solutions being developed address real needs.
    - heading: What types of projects will be funded?
      content: >-
        We're looking for proof-of-concept AI projects that address real-world
        challenges in local government. The call will not restrict topic areas
        (but you can read about areas that councils have already flagged as
        being of interest in our recent [ai@cam
        blog](https://www.ai.cam.ac.uk/blog/what-local-government-needs-from-ai-learning-from-practice-in-our-ai-for-local-government-accelerator).) 


        All projects must demonstrate clear public benefit potential. This might include:


        * AI tools and applications: AI capabilities to support specific service delivery challenges (for example, document processing, data analysis, prediction models).

        * Infrastructure and standards development: Frameworks, protocols, or integration layers that enable AI deployment across fragmented systems. This might include data sharing standards, orchestration platforms, or API specifications that allow different systems to work together.

        * Process redesign with AI enablement: Rethinking service delivery processes where AI is one component of a broader improvement. For example, simplifying a complex application process while using AI to support specific steps.
    - heading: How much funding is available?
      content: Individual projects can receive up to £25,000 for 6-12 months of
        proof-of-concept development. Additional support including technical
        clinics, monthly community of practice sessions, and programme
        management is provided by ai@cam.
    - heading: What is the project timeline?
      content: Funded projects must deliver within 12 months of receiving funding.
        This includes proof-of-concept development, testing with council
        partners, documentation of lessons learned, and presentation at the
        final showcase event. The timeline ensures solutions remain relevant to
        current council needs and maintains momentum for potential scaling.
    - heading: How will projects be selected?
      content: >-
        Proposals will be reviewed to consider their:


        * Public benefit potential: Does this address a need that will improve people's lives? Does the approach align with public expectations from our dialogue work, particularly regarding human oversight, transparency, and accessibility?

        * Technical feasibility: Can this be delivered within 9-12 months? Does the team have the right expertise? Are there insurmountable technical or governance barriers?

        * Strength of council partnerships: Is there collaboration with committed capacity? Can the team access real operational contexts for testing?

        * Delivery capability within 12 months; and 

        * Potential for scalability across multiple authorities: Could this work for multiple authorities? What would it take to adapt or adopt elsewhere? 

        * Learning value: Will this generate useful insights even if the AI approach doesn't work? Does the team have an idea about how to evaluate their impact?


        Selection criteria are informed by public dialogues carried out by ai@cam in autumn 2025. You can read more about those dialogues in this [ai@cam report. ](https://www.ai.cam.ac.uk/reports/2025-public-dialogue-on-ai-in-local-government-interim-results)
    - heading: What support will funded projects receive?
      content: >-
        Beyond financial support, funded projects will receive: monthly
        community of practice sessions to share progress and lessons learned
        with other funded teams; technical support clinics offering advice from
        ai@cam's machine learning engineers; and focused workshops on shared
        challenges.


        Alongside these project-specific activities, ai@cam will continue to convene networking sessions across councils to support sharing of lessons learned and successful solutions.
    - heading: Will projects need to be open source?
      content: We strongly encourage projects to adopt open-source licensing (BSD) to
        enable sector-wide adoption and sustainable scaling. This ensures that
        successful solutions can be adapted and implemented by other local
        authorities without costly licensing barriers, maximising the public
        benefit of the investment. However, we also understand there may be
        times when commercial considerations require other approaches.
