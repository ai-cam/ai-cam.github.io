    ai@cam is today announcing its inaugural AI Sciencepreneurship Bootcamp, an
    intensive two-day programme designed to help researchers transform
    breakthrough AI innovations in scientific research into real-world impact,
    across domains from health, to environment, to materials science, and more.
    Running from 25-26 June 2025, this hands-on bootcamp will combine technical
    expertise in scientific applications of AI with entrepreneurial insights
    from Cambridge's renowned innovation ecosystem, supporting the next
    generation of science-based ventures.


    Cambridge is home to over 5,500 knowledge-intensive businesses and the world's highest concentration of academic entrepreneurs. AI could help supercharge scientific discovery and innovation, driving a new wave of breakthroughs in areas from healthcare, to genomics, to sustainable energy. However, researchers looking to translate their scientific AI innovations face significant challenges, from designing AI tools tailored for specific scientific domains to building product-ready solutions from laboratory innovations. Many promising scientific AI breakthroughs never reach their full potential due to gaps in entrepreneurial knowledge and support.


    ai@cam’s new AI sciencepreneurship bootcamp will provide a pathway for researchers to develop their scientific AI innovations into viable ventures that address real-world scientific and technological challenges. This intensive program combines hands-on technical workshops with mentorship from experienced entrepreneurs and investors from Cambridge Innovation Capital. Participants will receive dedicated support to develop their AI tools while learning essential entrepreneurship skills. 


    From 25-26 June 2025, the first ai@cam Sciencepreneurship bootcamp will provide hands-on workshops, training, and mentoring to help researchers develop AI for science tools and learn more about entrepreneurship. The three-day programme will feature:

    - Technical workshops on foundation models and AI tools led by the Accelerate Science team

    - Training sessions on start-up fundamentals from Cambridge Innovation Capital

    - Problem-solution fit sessions with DeepTech Labs mentors

    - Founder story sessions with successful AI entrepreneurs

    - Hands-on prototype development with technical support

    - Pitch development and showcase opportunities with local entrepreneurs
     
    Applications are open to researchers and PhD students at the University of Cambridge and its associated institutions. To apply, please complete the form https://forms.gle/TEQedN8LtdhyJd8dA by Friday 6 June.
