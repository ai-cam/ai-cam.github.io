    ai@cam is today announcing its inaugural AI Sciencepreneurship Bootcamp, an
    intensive two-day programme designed to help researchers transform
    breakthrough AI innovations in scientific research into real-world impact,
    across domains from health, to environment, to materials science, and more.
    Running from 25-26 June 2025, this hands-on bootcamp will combine technical
    expertise in scientific applications of AI with entrepreneurial insights
    from Cambridge's renowned innovation ecosystem, supporting the next
    generation of science-based ventures.


    Cambridge is home to over 5,500 knowledge-intensive businesses and the world's highest concentration of academic entrepreneurs. AI could help supercharge scientific discovery and innovation, driving a new wave of breakthroughs in areas from healthcare, to genomics, to sustainable energy. However, researchers looking to translate their scientific AI innovations face significant challenges, from designing AI tools tailored for specific scientific domains to building product-ready solutions from laboratory innovations. Many promising scientific AI breakthroughs never reach their full potential due to gaps in entrepreneurial knowledge and support.
