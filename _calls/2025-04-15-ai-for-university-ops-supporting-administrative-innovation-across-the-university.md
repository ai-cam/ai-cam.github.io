    The programme will offer technical support and micro-grants for promising
    administrative AI projects, while also documenting existing successful use
    cases and creating a community of practice that helps scale successful
    applications.


    Professional services teams from across the University are invited to submit expressions of interest in engaging with this initiative by 09:00, 28 May 2025. This initial phase will help identify existing AI implementations and gather input on administrative challenges that could benefit from AI solutions. A launch workshop will follow on the 12 June, bringing together participants to share examples, develop collaborations, and network with colleagues facing similar challenges.


    If you would like to express interest in this initiative, please fill out the form here by 09:00 on 28 May 2025.

      content: The “AI for University Ops” programme provides a lightweight,
        integrated approach to supporting administrative AI adoption across the
        University. Building on our successful approach to enabling AI adoption
        in research, this programme will provide support for promising AI
        projects in administration, create opportunities to share successful
        practices, and build a community of practitioners.

        The programme operates in three phases:


        * Phase 1: Kick-off: We’re launching an Expression of Interest that invites PSS staff to suggest projects or applications they would be interested in developing and begins to log existing use cases.

        * Phase 2: Project proposals: On 12 June we’ll host a launch workshop that invites participants in the EOI to share example use cases, develop collaborations, and network. This will be followed by a call for projects that invites proposals for further work.

        * Phase 3: Implementation: Selected projects receive support and engage in community building activities.
