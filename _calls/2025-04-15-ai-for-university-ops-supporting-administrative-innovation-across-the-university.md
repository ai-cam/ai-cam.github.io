title: "'AI for University Ops': Supporting administrative innovation across the
  University"
excerpt: ai@cam is launching a new initiative to support administrative staff
  across the University to use AI to enhance University operations. The “AI for
  University Ops” programme will provide funding, technical support, and
  community building to help administrative teams implement AI solutions that
  address their operational challenges.

    The programme will offer technical support and micro-grants for promising
    administrative AI projects, while also documenting existing successful use
    cases and creating a community of practice that helps scale successful
    applications.


    Professional services teams from across the University are invited to submit expressions of interest in engaging with this initiative by 09:00, Wednesday 28 May 2025. This initial phase will help identify existing AI implementations and gather input on administrative challenges that could benefit from AI solutions. A launch workshop will follow on the 12 June, bringing together participants to share examples, develop collaborations, and network with colleagues facing similar challenges.


    If you would like to express interest in this initiative, please fill out the form here by 09:00 on 28 May 2025.

    - heading: What is AI for University Ops?
      content: The “AI for University Ops” programme provides a lightweight,
        integrated approach to supporting administrative AI adoption across the
        University. Building on our successful approach to enabling AI adoption
        in research, this programme will provide support for promising AI
        projects in administration, create opportunities to share successful
        practices, and build a community of practitioners.
    - heading: How does the programme work?
      content: >-
        

        The programme operates in three phases:


        * Phase 1: Kick-off: We’re launching an Expression of Interest that invites PSS staff to suggest projects or applications they would be interested in developing and begins to log existing use cases.

        * Phase 2: Project proposals: On 12 June we’ll host a launch workshop that invites participants in the EOI to share example use cases, develop collaborations, and network. This will be followed by a call for projects that invites proposals for further work.

        * Phase 3: Implementation: Selected projects receive support and engage in community building activities.
    - heading: What kinds of administrative challenges can be addressed?
      content: The first phase of this programme is challenge-agnostic, supporting any
        professional services function that could benefit from AI augmentation.
        Examples might include managing postgraduate admissions correspondence,
        streamlining document processing or routine administration such as
        note-taking.
    - heading: How much funding is available per project?
      content: This EOI is not an application for funding, though we anticipate that
        funding might be a component of the call for projects that follows.
        We’ll develop the specifics of our support offer based on feedback from
        our EOI. Our starting point is that we might offer small grants up to
        £10,000, depending on scope and potential impact. These grants are
        intended to cover implementation costs, such as potential software
        subscriptions or resource for data collection. They are not intended to
        cover staff time.
    - heading: Who can engage with this EOI?
      content: The programme is open to professional services and technical staff
        across all university departments. This first phase invites EOIs from
        all University staff with an interest in applying AI for University
        operations. In the next phase of work, we anticipate that project
        applications can come from individuals or teams; the lead should be a
        member of the Professional Services Staff.
    - heading: What if we’re already using AI tools in our department?
      content: We encourage you to share your existing implementations through the
        Expression of Interest form. This helps build our knowledge repository.
        Existing implementers may also be able to apply for funding to expand or
        enhance their current solutions.
    - heading: What technical expertise is required?
      content: No prior AI expertise is necessary, but a willingness to be proactive
        in learning how to implement these technologies is vital. The programme
        will provide technical support through Accelerate Science’s AI Clinic.
        The ideal applicant has a clear administrative challenge and willingness
        to learn, rather than existing technical skills.
    - heading: How will ethical concerns be addressed?
      content: At this stage of the programme, we are inviting expressions of interest
        in developing project ideas. When we are looking for projects or
        inviting applications for project support, we expect that each
        implementation should include consideration of ethical implications,
        particularly for projects handling sensitive data. We want to embed
        responsible AI principles in the use of AI in the University. The
        programme will encourage critical reflection on the use of AI as
        projects progress.
    - heading: What happens after the funding period?
      content: Successful implementations will be documented and shared through the
        digital hub and showcase event. A key aim of successful projects should
        be the mainstreaming of their AI tools.
    - heading: How will success be measured?
      content: When we invite project proposals, we will ask projects to define their
        success metrics as part of the application process. These might include
        time saved, error reduction, satisfaction ratings, or other quantifiable
        benefits. The programme’s overall success will be measured by number of
        implementations, cross-departmental adoption, and documented efficiency
        gains.
    - heading: How can I apply?
      content: Please fill in the expression of interest
        form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBFooODF_Ifbl2LUiXvyFMeAP1tqGf7qFk06qbO0ZIEuqKCw/viewform?usp=sharing) by
