    ai@cam announces its second AI Sciencepreneurship Bootcamp, an immersive
    two-day programme that helps researchers translate AI for science ideas to
    practice through entrepreneurship.


    Following the success of our first event in June 2025, ai@cam is launching the second edition of its AI Sciencepreneurship Bootcamp, an intensive two-day programme designed to help researchers transform breakthrough AI innovations in scientific research into real-world impact. 


    Running from 11-12 February 2026, this hands-on bootcamp will combine technical expertise in scientific applications of AI with entrepreneurial insights from Cambridge’s innovation ecosystem, supporting the next generation of science-based ventures.


    Cambridge is home to over 5,500 knowledge-intensive businesses and the world’s highest concentration of academic entrepreneurs. AI could help supercharge scientific discovery and innovation, driving a new wave of breakthroughs in areas from healthcare, to genomics, to sustainable energy. However, researchers looking to translate their scientific AI innovations face challenges, from designing AI tools tailored for specific scientific domains to building product-ready solutions from laboratory innovations.


    Our first bootcamp saw teams develop innovative ventures including Nature Network, an AI mapping tool to connect the public with the natural world; Ötzi, an AI-driven climate-risk modelling tool for insurance markets; and From Womb to World, an AI-powered digital health tool for IVF and high-risk pregnancies. Building on this momentum, this second edition will provide an enhanced pathway for researchers to develop their scientific AI innovations into viable ventures.

    develop AI for science tools and learn more about entrepreneurship. The
    two-day programme will feature:


    * Technical workshops on foundation models and AI tools led by the Accelerate Science team; 

    * Training sessions on start-up fundamentals from Cambridge Innovation Capital

    * Founder story sessions with successful AI entrepreneurs;

    * Pitch development and showcase opportunities with local entrepreneurs.


    Applications are open to researchers and PhD students at the University of Cambridge and its associated institutions. We encourage all applicants to read the FAQs below before applying. If you have any further questions, please reach out to Zoë Walker-Fagg ([zw249@cam.ac.uk](<>)).


    **The deadline for applications is 17:00 on Wednesday 28 January 2026.**

    - heading: Who can participate in this bootcamp?
      content: >-
        The bootcamp is open to PhD students, postdocs, and early-career
        researchers  at the University of Cambridge and its associated research
        institutions, working on AI applications in scientific domains such as
        biology, chemistry, physics, environmental science, healthcare, and
        related fields. Participants should have an understanding of core
        methods and concepts in AI and an idea for a project they'd like to
        develop. 


        As part of registration for the session, we will ask participants to agree to a confidentiality undertaking, to allow other participants in the workshop to share their ideas during discussions.
    - heading: What level of AI expertise is required to join?
      content: Participants should have foundational knowledge of AI methods and
        concepts. Those looking to build these skills can access preparatory
        courses through Accelerate Science's training programmes before
        applying. We find participants gain most from this workshop when they
        have an idea for an AI for science project that they would like to
        develop or are already working on.
