title: " AI in Local Government Fair "
excerpt: The AI in local government fair convenes council staff from across
  Cambridgeshire, Peterborough, and Greater Manchester with University of
  Cambridge AI researchers. Local government teams will showcase posters
  outlining challenges where AI could make a difference - from streamlining
  social care documentation to optimising transport routes to processing
  planning applications.

    First-of-its-kind "challenge fair" connects council staff with university
    researchers to tackle real-world problems in AI for public services.

  content: >-
    Local government staff will have the chance to find academic partners who
    can help them use AI to tackle their biggest operational challenges at a new
    event this November.


    ai@cam’s new AI in local government fair, held on the 24th November, flips the traditional conference model: instead of researchers presenting their work, council staff will present their biggest operational challenges and ideas for how AI might help address them.


    As councils increasingly look to artificial intelligence to improve services and meet rising demand, the AI in local government fair will connect the frontline knowledge of local authorities with Cambridge’s research expertise. By spotlighting real pressures faced by councils – from social care paperwork to planning backlogs and transport congestion – the fair creates a two-way marketplace, designed to explore how AI could provide practical solutions.

  content: >-
    The AI in local government fair brings together council staff from across
    Cambridgeshire, Peterborough, and Greater Manchester with University of
    Cambridge AI researchers. Local government teams will showcase posters
    outlining challenges where AI could make a difference - from streamlining
    social care documentation to optimising transport routes to processing
    planning applications.


    Researchers will browse the challenge presentations in a “reverse” poster session, leading to informal discussions and potential collaborations. Promising collaborations from the poster session will then be eligible for ai@cam’s AI for Local Government Accelerator funding programme, launching later this year to support proof-of-concept development.


    The AI in local government fair creates a two-way marketplace: council staff will showcase challenge posters outlining where AI could make a difference, while University researchers will provide profiles of their expertise and research interests via the event registration process. This dual approach ensures council staff can identify researchers with relevant capabilities, while researchers can spot challenges that align with their technical skills and research goals.

  faqs:
    - heading: What makes this a "reverse" poster session?
      content: Unlike traditional academic conferences where researchers present their
        work, council staff will present their operational challenges and ideas
        for AI solutions. University researchers will browse these challenge
        presentations to find collaboration opportunities.
    - heading: What types of challenges should councils present?
      content: "**Any public service challenge where AI might help - from reducing
        social care paperwork and processing planning applications to optimising
        transport routes and improving customer services. We're particularly
        interested in challenges that could benefit multiple councils if
        solved.**"
    - content: Local council staff from Cambridgeshire, Peterborough, and Greater
        Manchester, plus University of Cambridge researchers with AI expertise.
        Council staff don't need technical AI knowledge - domain expertise in
        public services is what we're looking for.
      heading: "Who can attend? "
    - heading: "What happens if I find a potential collaborator? "
      content: University - council partnerships will be eligible for dedicated
        funding in our second phase to develop proof-of-concept solutions. We'll
        provide structured follow-up to help promising collaborations move
        forward.
    - heading: Do I need to be technical to participate as a council staff member?
      content: Not at all. We want people who understand the real operational
        challenges councils face.
    - heading: What should my poster include?
      content: |-
        

        * The specific challenge you're facing
        * Why current approaches aren't working
        * Your ideas (even rough ones) for how AI might help
        * The potential impact if this problem were solved
        * Any relevant data or context about scale
    - heading: How long is the poster session?
      content: 4 hours (13:00-17:00) including lunch and refreshments. This gives time
        for meaningful conversations rather than rushed presentations.
    - heading: "What happens after the session? "
      content: Later this year, ai@cam will be launching its AI for Local Government
        Accelerator, which will invite applications for funding and
        incubator-style support for collaborative projects between the
        University and local government.
    - content: " While we welcome poster presentations from all participating
        councils, we anticipate that our AI for Local Government Accelerator
        funding programme will be held by University of Cambridge researchers.
        However, solutions developed could potentially benefit councils across
        all participating regions, and we anticipate that all funding proposals
        should include at least one council partner. Full guidance on this will
        be published after the poster session."
      heading: Who will be eligible for follow-up funding?
    - content: The session itself provides valuable networking and learning
        opportunities. Many councils find that discussing their challenges with
        researchers generates new insights even without formal collaboration.
      heading: What if my idea doesn't lead to a collaboration?
    - heading: How do I know if my challenge is suitable for AI?
      content: If you're dealing with large volumes of data, repetitive tasks, pattern
        recognition needs, or complex decision support - AI might help.
    - content: "**Absolutely. We encourage this where it makes sense - shared
        challenges often lead to more impactful and sustainable solutions.**"
      heading: Can multiple councils work on the same challenge?
    - content: >-
        Create your poster in A0 portrait format (841mm x 1189mm) using software
        like PowerPoint, Canva, or Google Slides. We can print it for you if you
        email the PDF to contact@ai.cam.ac.uk by 17:00 on Monday 17 November, or
        you can arrange your own printing (allow 2-3 working days).


        For effective posters: use a clear, bold title; organise content logically with digestible sections; stick to 2-3 complementary colours and clean fonts; include visuals like charts or diagrams; use bullet points and avoid jargon; and include your contact details.
      heading: How do I create the poster?
    - heading: How do I apply?
      content: Complete the registration form
        [here](https://forms.gle/DZx8ogsHmf1Bejrd8) by 14 November and send us
        your poster by 17 November if you would like us to print it.
