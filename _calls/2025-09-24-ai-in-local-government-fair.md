    - heading: What makes this a "reverse" poster session?
      content: Unlike traditional academic conferences where researchers present their
        work, council staff will present their operational challenges and ideas
        for AI solutions. University researchers will browse these challenge
        presentations to find collaboration opportunities.
    - heading: What types of challenges should councils present?
      content: "**Any public service challenge where AI might help - from reducing
        social care paperwork and processing planning applications to optimising
        transport routes and improving customer services. We're particularly
        interested in challenges that could benefit multiple councils if
        solved.**"
    - content: Local council staff from Cambridgeshire, Peterborough, and Greater
        Manchester, plus University of Cambridge researchers with AI expertise.
        Council staff don't need technical AI knowledge - domain expertise in
        public services is what we're looking for.
      heading: "Who can attend? "
    - heading: "What happens if I find a potential collaborator? "
      content: University - council partnerships will be eligible for dedicated
        funding in our second phase to develop proof-of-concept solutions. We'll
        provide structured follow-up to help promising collaborations move
        forward.
