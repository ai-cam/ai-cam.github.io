excerpt: The AI in local government fair convenes council staff from across
  Cambridgeshire, Peterborough, and Greater Manchester with University of
  Cambridge AI researchers. Local government teams will showcase posters
  outlining challenges where AI could make a difference - from streamlining
  social care documentation to optimising transport routes to processing
  planning applications.

    Local government staff will have the chance to find academic partners who can help them use AI to tackle their biggest operational challenges at a new event this November.


    ai@cam’s AI in local government fair on 24 November flips the traditional conference model: instead of researchers presenting their work, council staff will present their biggest operational challenges and ideas for how AI might help address them.


    Local government is increasingly turning to AI as they seek new ways to improve public services and respond to growing community needs. Early adopters are already seeing promising results that benefit both staff and residents. AI tools are helping social care workers spend more time with service users, councils respond faster to infrastructure problems, and planning teams process community consultations more efficiently.


    How it works


    The AI in local government fair  brings together council staff from across Cambridgeshire, Peterborough, and Greater Manchester with University of Cambridge AI researchers. Local government teams will showcase posters outlining challenges where AI could make a difference - from streamlining social care documentation to optimising transport routes to processing planning applications.


    Researchers will browse the challenge presentations in a “reverse” poster session, leading to informal discussions and potential collaborations. Promising collaborations from the poster session will then be eligible for ai@cam's AI for Local Government Accelerator funding programme, launching later this year to support proof-of-concept development.


    The AI in local government fair creates a two-way marketplace: council staff will showcase challenge posters outlining where AI could make a difference, while University researchers will provide profiles of their expertise and research interests via the event registration process. This dual approach ensures council staff can identify researchers with relevant capabilities, while researchers can spot challenges that align with their technical skills and research goals.

    - heading: What makes this a "reverse" poster session?
      content: Unlike traditional academic conferences where researchers present their
        work, council staff will present their operational challenges and ideas
        for AI solutions. University researchers will browse these challenge
        presentations to find collaboration opportunities.
    - heading: What types of challenges should councils present?
      content: "**Any public service challenge where AI might help - from reducing
        social care paperwork and processing planning applications to optimising
        transport routes and improving customer services. We're particularly
        interested in challenges that could benefit multiple councils if
        solved.**"
    - content: Local council staff from Cambridgeshire, Peterborough, and Greater
        Manchester, plus University of Cambridge researchers with AI expertise.
        Council staff don't need technical AI knowledge - domain expertise in
        public services is what we're looking for.
      heading: "Who can attend? "
    - heading: "What happens if I find a potential collaborator? "
      content: University - council partnerships will be eligible for dedicated
        funding in our second phase to develop proof-of-concept solutions. We'll
        provide structured follow-up to help promising collaborations move
        forward.
