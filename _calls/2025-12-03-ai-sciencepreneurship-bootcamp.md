    ai@cam announces its second AI Sciencepreneurship Bootcamp, an immersive
    two-day programme that helps researchers translate AI for science ideas to
    practice through entrepreneurship.


    Following the success of our first event in June 2025, ai@cam is launching the second edition of its AI Sciencepreneurship Bootcamp, an intensive two-day programme designed to help researchers transform breakthrough AI innovations in scientific research into real-world impact. Running from 11-12 February 2026, this hands-on bootcamp will combine technical expertise in scientific applications of AI with entrepreneurial insights from Cambridge's innovation ecosystem, supporting the next generation of science-based ventures.


    Cambridge is home to over 5,500 knowledge-intensive businesses and the world's highest concentration of academic entrepreneurs. AI could help supercharge scientific discovery and innovation, driving a new wave of breakthroughs in areas from healthcare, to genomics, to sustainable energy. However, researchers looking to translate their scientific AI innovations face challenges, from designing AI tools tailored for specific scientific domains to building product-ready solutions from laboratory innovations.


    Our first bootcamp saw teams develop innovative ventures including Nature Network, an AI mapping tool to connect the public with the natural world; Ötzi, an AI-driven climate-risk modelling tool for insurance markets; and From Womb to World, an AI-powered digital health tool for IVF and high-risk pregnancies. Building on this momentum, this second edition will provide an enhanced pathway for researchers to develop their scientific AI innovations into viable ventures.

        The bootcamp is open to PhD students, postdocs, and early-career
        researchers  at the University of Cambridge and its associated research
        institutions, working on AI applications in scientific domains such as
        biology, chemistry, physics, environmental science, healthcare, and
        related fields. Participants should have an understanding of core
        methods and concepts in AI and an idea for a project they'd like to
        develop. 


        As part of registration for the session, we will ask participants to agree to a confidentiality undertaking, to allow other participants in the workshop to share their ideas during discussions.
