  New funding scheme supports collaborative research projects between University
  of Cambridge and local authorities.


  The University of Cambridge is launching a new funding scheme to support collaborative AI research and development projects with local government partners. The ai@cam Local Government AI Accelerator will provide grants of up to £25,000 for proof-of-concept projects that address shared challenges across multiple councils.


  The fund represents a new approach to AI innovation in public services, connecting academic expertise with real-world operational needs. Projects must demonstrate clear buy-in from at least one local authority partner, be led by a University of Cambridge researcher eligible to hold funding, and deliver results within 12 months.


  The initiative builds on ai@cam’s work with local government partners across Cambridgeshire and beyond. Early AI adopters in local government are already demonstrating the technology’s potential in areas like social care, planning consultation analysis, and infrastructure maintenance. This collaboration aims to support councils in identifying promising AI applications and developing appropriate solutions.

  Funded projects will receive up to £25,000 for 9-12 months of proof-of-concept
  development, with ongoing support through monthly community of practice
  sessions and technical support clinics with ai@cam’s machine learning
  engineers. A final showcase will document lessons learned and explore pathways
  for scaling successful solutions across the sector.


  Proposals must be submitted by 16.00 on Friday 13 February and should demonstrate clear partnership with at least one local authority.


  To apply, we ask for some basic project information, a two page project proposal, and supporting documents to demonstrate local authority support and headline spending plans.


  **Information session** We will also be hosting an upcoming Q&A information session about the funding scheme on **10:00 - 11:00,** **Thursday 15 January.** You can [register for this session here](https://cam-ac-uk.zoom.us/meeting/register/SRLizoXXSIKVHMrruc7H6g)


  We encourage all applicants to read the FAQs below before applying. If you have any further questions around eligibility or the application process, please contact Jess Montgomery (jkm40@cam.ac.uk.)

faq_title: FAQ's
faqs:
  - answer: The fund provides grants of up to £25,000 to support collaborative
      research projects between University of Cambridge researchers and local
      government partners. It aims to develop proof-of-concept AI solutions that
      address challenges in public service delivery in local authorities.
    question: What is the ai@cam local government innovation fund?
  - question: Who can apply for funding?
    answer: >-
      Applications must be led by a researcher based at the University of
      Cambridge and demonstrate clear buy-in from at least one local authority
      partner. We encourage applications that address challenges shared across
      multiple councils, as these have greater potential for sector-wide impact.


      We have already heard from some local authority partners about areas where they would welcome support during a workshop on 24 November 2025. You can read more about these areas on our recent ai@cam blog.
  - question: What level of council involvment is required?
    answer: Projects must have engagement with local authority partners throughout
      development, not just at the application stage. This means ongoing
      engagement with council staff who understand the operational context and
      can help ensure the solutions being developed address real needs.
  - question: What types of projects will be funded?
    answer: >-
      We’re looking for proof-of-concept AI projects that address real-world
      challenges in local government. The call will not restrict topic areas
      (but you can read about areas that councils have already flagged as being
      of interest in our recent ai@cam blog.)


      All projects must demonstrate clear public benefit potential. This might include:


      * AI tools and applications: AI capabilities to support specific service delivery challenges (for example, document processing, data analysis, prediction models).

      * Infrastructure and standards development: Frameworks, protocols, or integration layers that enable AI deployment across fragmented systems. This might include data sharing standards, orchestration platforms, or API specifications that allow different systems to work together.

      * Process redesign with AI enablement: Rethinking service delivery processes where AI is one component of a broader improvement. For example, simplifying a complex application process while using AI to support specific steps.
  - question: How much funding is available?
    answer: Individual projects can receive up to £25,000 for 6-12 months of
      proof-of-concept development. Additional support including technical
      clinics, monthly community of practice sessions, and programme management
      is provided by ai@cam.
  - question: What is the project timeline?
    answer: Funded projects must deliver within 12 months of receiving funding. This
      includes proof-of-concept development, testing with council partners,
      documentation of lessons learned, and presentation at the final showcase
      event. The timeline ensures solutions remain relevant to current council
      needs and maintains momentum for potential scaling.
