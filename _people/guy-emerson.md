  Guy develops methods in AI and machine learning, with a focus on understanding
  language.


  He supports interdisciplinary research across the University, as an Executive Director of Cambridge Language Sciences.


  He is interested in applications of AI in many domains, and for example has worked on a project in Somalia in partnership with UNICEF, on listening to citizens' opinions on a range of healthcare topics. He is currently a co-Investigator on the AI@Cam project "Improving language equity and inclusion through AI". 


  He would be happy to advise on the feasibility and potential strengths and weaknesses of AI applications, particularly those related to language. This includes large language models (LLMs), as well as many other kinds of model. In general, it is critical to understand what kinds of mistake an AI system might make, how problematic those mistakes are, how frequent they are, and how the resulting risks could be mitigated.
