  Catherine is a journalist and writer who leads all Innovation and Translation
  work at the Kavli Centre for Ethics, Science, and the Public. She loves
  sparking conversations on the things that matter through creative storytelling
  and connecting diverse audiences. Her current projects include The Hopes and
  Fears Lab - a "conversation experiment" that encourages discovery scientists
  and members of the public to sit down together to discuss the future we all
  share. This artist-designed Lab looks nothing like a regular lab, and is a
  place where everyone, regardless of their personal history or background
  knowledge, can meet as equals to tackle the big questions together. Her own
  favourite question is ‘What if …?’


  Alongside her work at the Kavli Centre, Catherine presents and produces the ‘Thoughtlines’ podcast for CRASSH at the University of Cambridge, where she asks academics in the Arts, Social Sciences, and Humanities to share their research passions and the unusual routes they took to their current day job – including being expelled from school, a stint as an elite gymnast, and accidentally doing a business degree.


  She has also made film and audio content for Cambridge Digital Humanities and the Cambridge Judge Business School. Before becoming a journalist, Catherine completed her PhD in Comparative Literature at the Department of Italian at Cambridge. She then spent 13 years as a TV and Radio presenter in Paris for France 24 television and Radio France Internationale, and teaching on the bi-lingual journalism Masters degree course at L'Ecole de Journalisme de Sciences Po.
