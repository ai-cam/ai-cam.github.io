biography: I am a social scientist (PhD LSE, 2018) working at the intersection
  of expert decision-making, risk and technology policy. I am interested in
  understanding the long-term impacts of frontier AI systems on social and
  democratic processes and developing interventions that can shape these impacts
  and mitigate extreme risks. I am also Principal Investigator of the “Measuring
  the quality of collective reasoning” project, funded by the British Academy
  and a member of the next generation Event Horizon Telescope collaboration,
  where I lead the taskforces on expert forecasting and dissent.
