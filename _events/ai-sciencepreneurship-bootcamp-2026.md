Following the success of our first event in June 2025, ai@cam is launching the second edition of its AI Sciencepreneurship Bootcamp, an intensive two-day programme designed to help researchers transform breakthrough AI innovations in scientific research into real-world impact. \

Running from 11-12 February 2026, this hands-on bootcamp will combine technical expertise in scientific applications of AI with entrepreneurial insights from Cambridge’s innovation ecosystem, supporting the next generation of science-based ventures.

The two-day programme will feature:

* Technical workshops on foundation models and AI tools led by the Accelerate Science team;
* Training sessions on start-up fundamentals from Cambridge Innovation Capital;
* Founder story sessions with successful AI entrepreneurs;
* Pitch development and showcase opportunities with local entrepreneurs.

Applications are open to researchers and PhD students at the University of Cambridge and its associated institutions. If you have any further questions, please reach out to Zoë Walker-Fagg ([zw249@cam.ac.uk](<>)).\
