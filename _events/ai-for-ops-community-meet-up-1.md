ai@cam invites you to join us for our community Lunch & Learn as part of the AI for Ops programme.

This session offers university staff an opportunity to learn how colleagues are leveraging AI and automation to enhance operational effectiveness. Whether you are beginning to explore AI applications within your work or actively implementing tools, this event provides a valuable forum to exchange insights and share best practice. We invite presentations of brief case studies, work-in-progress updates, or current challenges to foster shared learning and collaboration. Registration for this event will open at the end of July.
