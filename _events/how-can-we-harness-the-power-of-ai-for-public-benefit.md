As artificial intelligence continues to advance at a rapid pace, how can we harness its potential to improve public services?

​Join ai@cam for this panel discussion as we bring together leading experts and local government officials to explore how artificial intelligence could transform public service delivery and address real-world challenges in local government.

​Our expert panel includes:

* ​Jess Montgomery, Director, ai@cam
* ​Liz Watts, Chief Executive of South Cambridgeshire District Council
* ​Robert Pollock, Chief Executive of Cambridge City Council

​This event is part of this year’s Cambridge Festival, the University of Cambridge's annual celebration of research and ideas.  

​Our panel discussion will take place in the Debating Chamber at the Cambridge Union, 9a Bridge Street, Cambridge CB2 1UB.
