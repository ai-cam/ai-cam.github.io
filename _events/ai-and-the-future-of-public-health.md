  At Cambridge, we’re exploring how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used
  responsibly to improve lives and strengthen communities. From predicting
  disease outbreaks to streamlining care, AI holds great promise for public
  health but will these benefits reach everyone? How can local services and
  researchers work together to harness AI’s potential?


  Join us as we bring together health professionals, researchers and the public to explore the practical challenges and opportunities of using AI to create healthier communities.
