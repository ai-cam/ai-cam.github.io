**Time & Date:** 13.00-14.00 | Tuesday 13 May\
**Location:** Online\
**Organisers:** Bennett Institute for Public Policy

Researchers at the Bennett Institute for Public Policy and PolicyWISE have been examining the newly established the Council of Nations and Regions – the UK government’s new flagship intergovernmental initiative – offering recommendations to help shape its future direction.

Their new report (to be co-published mid-May 2025) discusses the potential for improved relationships between the UK government, devolved governments, and English mayors through collaborative engagement. It details the need for a clearly defined purpose for the Council, the challenges of intergovernmental relations, and provides recommendations for its design and scope.

**During this webinar, the authors will draw on their research to discuss:**

* Collective governance – new ways of working across administrations
* Strategic focus – the Council of Nations and Region’s remit and how it enables policy learning and coordination
* The English question – who speaks for England and how is it represented?
* Accountability – the role for parliaments and scrutiny

There will be time for questions from the audience.

#### Speakers:

* Professor Michael Kenny, Bennett Institute for Public Policy, University of Cambridge
* Alex Walker, Bennett Institute for Public Policy, University of Cambridge
* Dewi Knight, PolicyWISE, The Open University
* Chaired by Catherine May, PolicyWISE, The Open University)
