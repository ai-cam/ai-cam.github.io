**Entente CordIAle Workshop**

The inaugural Entente CordIAle Workshop marks the first engagement under a new AI collaboration between the UK and France. Bringing together senior researchers from the Saclay cluster (Institut Polytechnique de Paris, HEC Paris, and Université Paris-Saclay) and colleagues from Oxford and Cambridge Universities, the workshop focuses on identifying strategic areas for collaboration in artificial intelligence, with a particular emphasis on AI for science and open innovation.

The programme combines keynote talks, panel discussions, and working sessions, showcasing research directions in AI for science and exploring opportunities for collaboration within this strategic partnership.
