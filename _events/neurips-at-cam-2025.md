## Programme Overview

NeurIPS@Cam 2025 is part of the AI for Science Summit (9 to 10 December 2025) hosted by the [Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery](https://science.ai.cam.ac.uk/), a two day event celebrating advances in machine learning and their impact across scientific domains. On the second day of the Summit, NeurIPS@Cam brings together students, researchers, and engineers across the Cambridge community for a full day dedicated to discussing work presented at NeurIPS and related advances in AI research. The day is organised in partnership with the [Cambridge Centre for Data Driven Discovery (C2D3)](https://www.c2d3.cam.ac.uk/), and the first half of the programme is delivered jointly with C2D3. 

The joint C2D3/NeurIPS@Cam morning session will include talks on new ways to solve problems along with a keynote. The afternoon programme (for NeurIPS@Cam) consists of two presentation sessions followed by a panel discussion. All speakers present their ongoing research, and the event provides a space to share ongoing research, exchange ideas, and strengthen connections across the local AI community.
