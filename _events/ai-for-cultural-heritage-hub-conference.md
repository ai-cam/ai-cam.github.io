  **AI for Cultural Heritage Hub Conference**


  How can AI address challenges in the cultural heritage sector?


  Join us in-person or online for a conference introducing the **[AI for Cultural Heritage Hub (ArCH)](http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/arch)**, a proof-of-concept project drawing on case studies from libraries, archives and museums across the University of Cambridge.


  ArCH has created a prototype workspace (the “hub”), designed to help GLAM professionals and academics analyse cultural heritage data securely using AI tools. From piecing together fragments of ancient papyrus to transcribing card catalogues, the conference will introduce the project’s six case studies and showcase the functionality of the hub.


  The ArCH project is led by the University Library Research Institute in collaboration with the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics and the Collections, Connections, Communities Strategic Research Initiative at the University of Cambridge. It is supported by funding from ai@cam and the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery, made possible by a donation from Schmidt Sciences.


  Free to attend. Registration required.
