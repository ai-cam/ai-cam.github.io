The relationship between the body and mind of a robot has been a topic of debate for centuries, driving scientists to explore intelligent and adaptive behaviour in both animals and machines. In robotics, this relationship is critical to designing systems that can interact meaningfully with their environments, adapt to new challenges, and exhibit humanlike intelligence. Embodied Intelligence studies how physical interactions shape thoughts, emotions, and actions—not just in humans but also in robots.

In the age of AI and Machine Learning, this research is vital, offering insights that enhance traditional AI technologies by integrating physical embodiment and environmental interaction. Robotics plays a central role in this exploration, serving as both a tool for studying intelligence and a field that benefits directly from embodied principles.

This topic is particularly relevant and timely given the underrepresentation of women in robotics. Promoting diverse perspectives is essential for fostering innovation and ensuring that the field reflects a broad range of ideas and experiences. By engaging young researchers, especially women, this workshop aims to inspire participation and contributions to a field where diversity is needed to address complex challenges and drive meaningful progress.

This event is organised by the [Women-in-Robotics Cambridge](https://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/news/cambridge-researchers-showcase-robots-globalwiin) initiative and the Centre for Human-Inspired AI (CHIA) as a continuation of the success of our [previous workshops](https://birlab.org/events/) on Embodied Intelligence and Women-in-Robotics. The workshop will host approximately 30 participants.
