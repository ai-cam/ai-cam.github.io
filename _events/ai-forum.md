The AI Forum is a platform for the AI ecosystem to support, track and constructively challenge the Government in delivering the *AI Opportunities Action Plan* over the next two years. 

It also serves as a model for building grassroots communities that can generate valuable, bottom-up insights on the real challenges being faced on the ground.
