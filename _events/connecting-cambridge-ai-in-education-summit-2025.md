Welcome to the Connecting Cambridge: AI in Education Summit 2025.

Join us at the Triangle Building at Cambridge University Press & Assessment for a half day filled with insightful discussions, interactive roundtable, and networking opportunities.

This event brings together AI practitioners and thought leaders across Cambridge university. With a focus on knowledge-sharing and networking, this event will provide opportunities for future collaboration and strengthening our relationships and our impact for the benefit of society.

The half-day summit will help participants to understand what they are all working on with the different perspectives each brings – and it may even lead to strategic partnerships for the future. By spending the day together, participants will be able to better understand the synergies and challenges that they face collectively and build a supportive community.

The day will be supported by an exhibition space along with interactive demos.
