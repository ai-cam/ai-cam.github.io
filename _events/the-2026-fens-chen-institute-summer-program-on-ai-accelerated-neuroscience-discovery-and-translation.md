  The summer school will offer students an opportunity to engage with local and international experts, as well as Industry partners from across Cambridge’s innovation ecosystem. There will also be plenty of time to explore Cambridge’s beautiful landscapes, architecture and history.


  Postdocs, PhD students or MRes students, with a background in mathematics, engineering, computer science, or neuroscience are welcome to apply. Experience with programming (e.g. python, R, matlab) is beneficial. Experience with AI and machine learning is desirable but not necessary.
