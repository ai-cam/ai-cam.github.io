**Business and the Atomic Human: Strategic Decision Making in the Age** 

As AI technologies reshape the business landscape, leaders face questions about balancing automation with individual judgment, information flows, and organisational decision-making. This talk builds on the ideas in Atomic Human to explore the practical implications of AI for businesses through the lens of information topography, decision-making structures, and human-AI collaboration. Drawing from real-world examples and insights from the book we’ll explore how businesses can strategically implement AI while maintaining human agency, intelligent accountability, and organisational effectiveness.\
