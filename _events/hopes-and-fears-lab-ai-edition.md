As part of this year's Cambridge Festival, The Copper Kettle is opening its door to welcome the public for our pop-up conversation lab on all things AI. \
\
Sit down in our bespoke cardboard lab for mini conversations with researchers at the forefront of this technology. Hear about their work, ask questions, and share your own hopes and fears about the future of AI. 
Do we feel hopeful about the benefits this technology could bring us? Where is there potential for AI to make real differences to our lives and our society? \
\
From Alexa, to FitBit, to Netflix and ChatGPT - artificial Intelligence is already shaping our daily lives. But now is the time to decide together how it should shape our future.\
\
There are no silly questions in the (cardboard!) lab, just great conversations. Everyone is welcome. Drop in anytime from 16.00 - 20.00!
