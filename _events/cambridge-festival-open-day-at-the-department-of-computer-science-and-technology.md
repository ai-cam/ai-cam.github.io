  Take a virtual tour of the Dawn supercomputer. Chat with a robot or make music
  with code. Discover how AI can help you with your insomnia, or turn you into a
  guitar genius. Try solving the logic puzzles that unlock a pirate's treasure
  chest. Or have a go at some Computer Science 'Taskmaster'-style tasks. 

  These are just some of the activities visitors can try at our Cambridge Festival Open Day on Saturday 22 March 2025.
