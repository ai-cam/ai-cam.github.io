Join renowned economist Diane Coyle for the launch of her latest book, The Measure of Progress: Counting What Really Matters, which explores how outdated economic metrics are distorting our understanding of today’s digital economy. Developed in the 1940s, today’s frameworks that guide our economic statistics no longer align with the challenges of the modern world. Diane argues that these outdated tools hinder policymakers’ ability to accurately measure and address issues such as slowing growth, political tension, and the impact of technological innovation.

Diane calls for a new framework—one that reflects the realities of our economy today, emphasising the importance of intangible value and adjusting to the digital age. She explains how improving economic statistics is vital for shaping better policies and ensuring more equitable growth for all. This is a must-attend event and read for anyone interested in the future of economics, democracy, and society.

Diane will be joined in conversation by Gillian Tett. A book signing with Diane will follow.
