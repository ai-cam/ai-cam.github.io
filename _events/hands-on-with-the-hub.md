  Get hands-on with the AI for Cultural Heritage Hub (ArCH)!


  **Hands on with the Hub**


  **Friday 20 March 2026, 11:00am-1:00pm GMT**


  **Milstein Room, Cambridge University Library**


  ArCH is a prototype workspace designed for GLAM professionals and academics to analyse cultural heritage data securely with AI tools.


  Bring along your data or challenging use cases - whether that’s card catalogues that need converting into machine-readable format, texts to transcribe and structure (in any language or script!), or images to analyse - and help us put ArCH to the test.


  Members of the project team will talk through your use case or research question with you, and explore how the hub might address it.


  Important information


  1. Please bring any associated data on a portable storage device (e.g. USB) and use PDF, JPEG or TIFF file formats if possible.

  2. This is a drop-in session, but please book to help us to manage numbers.
