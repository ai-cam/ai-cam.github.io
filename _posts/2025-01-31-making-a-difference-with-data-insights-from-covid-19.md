excerpt: When the COVID-19 pandemic first emerged across the UK in early 2020,
  policy-makers in the East of England turned to Dennis Gillings Professor of
  Health Management Stefan Scholtes at the University of Cambridge Judge
  Business School for help. Drawing on 25 years’ experience at the University of
  Cambridge and with six years as Chair of the Board of the 60,000-patient
  Granta Medical Practices in Cambridgeshire under his belt, Professor Scholtes
  convened a multi-disciplinary team of statisticians and public health experts

When the COVID-19 pandemic first emerged across the UK in early 2020, policy-makers in the East of England turned to Dennis Gillings Professor of Health Management Stefan Scholtes at the University of Cambridge Judge Business School for help. Drawing on 25 years’ experience at the University of Cambridge and with six years as Chair of the Board of the 60,000-patient Granta Medical Practices in Cambridgeshire under his belt, Professor Scholtes convened a multi-disciplinary team of statisticians and public health experts who could help to analyse regional data to inform crucial policy decisions on a local level.

With a health crisis emerging before their eyes, NHS colleagues in the East of England needed rapid advice to help plan their regional response. One of the key questions they needed to answer was how many COVID-19 admissions there might be in each of the hospitals across the East of England. That was the “exam question” that Professor Scholtes and his team took as a starting point.

They combined data from daily situational reports produced by each of the hospitals across the region with national Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data that provided granular patient-by-patient information to build an innovative model that helped to predict the regional timing and size of the pandemic’s peak. They also investigated how to use new data sources, such as mobility data based on mobile usage, to help predict the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

Throughout the first 12 months of the pandemic, Professor Scholtes and his team held weekly Zoom meetings with policymakers from NHS East of England and Public Health England who were making key decisions to help plan everything from the number of ventilators needed to the projected number of hospital beds. Based on this crucial regional analysis, policymakers decided not to open emergency Nightingale Hospitals in the East of England, which helped to save the NHS many millions of pounds.

“I think we did make a different decision because we did have different data,” says Professor Scholtes. “It’s all about making better informed judgements.”

Although the data wasn’t shared publicly, for confidentiality reasons, papers were published about the innovative model developed by the team.29 The partnership between policymakers and academia played a pivotal role in the region’s pandemic response, earning Professor Scholtes and his team a Collaboration Award in the University of Cambridge’s Vice Chancellor’s Awards for Research Impact and Engagement in 2022.

#### Overcoming barriers

Most of the data Professor Scholtes and his team relied on for their analysis was owned and managed by the NHS. Because it was a health emergency, access to the information they needed was a lot faster than usual, although Professor Scholtes is quick to point out that the data was still hosted securely on a University server, and standard protocols were followed at all times.

“The COVID project was an example of where pragmatism overruled barriers that are sometimes constraining,” says Professor Scholtes. “Normally you have to go through lots of hoops to get to the data that you need. In this case there were shortcuts; they were not dangerous shortcuts because we were very aware of the sensitivity of the data, but they just made our lives a lot easier and a lot faster.”
