AI is reshaping the way we access and interpret cultural heritage collections, from transcribing fragile manuscripts to piecing together fragmented artefacts. At Cambridge University Library, Dr Amelie Roper and her team are leading the AI for Cultural Heritage Hub (ArCH) project, a new initiative exploring how AI can reveal hidden collections while placing expert knowledge, ethical practice, and sustainability at its core.

What was the inspiration AI for Cultural Heritage Hub (ArCH) project and what was the gap that it aims to address?

The AI for Cultural Heritage Hub (ArCH) grew out of two main inspirations: the untapped potential of the vast and diverse collections across Cambridge’s libraries, archives, galleries, museums, and herbarium - many of which remain underexplored - and the belief that cultural heritage should be accessible to everyone, whether it that be for research, inspiration or enjoyment.

The project aims to create a secure, replicable workspace (the “hub”) that will enable non-technical users - those working in galleries, libraries, archives and museums, and academics without any specialist technical expertise - to analyse cultural heritage data securely with AI tools. Cultural heritage data means data about the items held in cultural heritage collections. The most typical types of data are collections metadata (descriptions of items in collections) and digital images of collection items.

ArCH addresses the lack of a secure “sandpit” where AI tools can be used on cultural heritage datasets using workflows that are accessible to those with limited technical expertise. The hub’s infrastructure will be open source and built on internationally-recognised standards, ensuring that it can be reused, scaled, and further developed by others. Beyond the technical platform, ArCH is also fostering a community of practice, through events and workshops, to surface common challenges, and build confidence in the responsible use of AI for cultural heritage collections.

**How does it tackle some of today’s major challenges when it comes to GLAM institutions (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums)?**

Cultural heritage organisations around the world hold billions of items that remain inaccessible. While there are many reasons for this, one of the most fundamental is that vast numbers of items are simply not discoverable. In many cases, no publicly available descriptions exist, leaving objects effectively invisible to anyone outside the institutions that house them. Even when items are discoverable, they are often preserved in formats that are difficult to access or do not meet users’ needs. For example, a manuscript may need transcription or an artefact may survive only in thousands of fragments that are impossible for humans to piece together unaided.

ArCH is tackling the accessibility of collections by focusing on three core challenges.

Challenge 1 is unlocking inaccessible data by using AI transcription and computer vision tools on digitised documents. While transcription can be carried out manually, the vast scale of untranscribed material, and the time required to process it, far exceeds the staffing capacity of most cultural heritage organisations.

Challenge 2 is reconstructing fragmentary or dispersed cultural objects, enabling new insights into their form, meaning, and historical context.

Challenge 3 is embedding expert cultural knowledge into AI algorithms, drawing not only on academic expertise but also on the knowledge of practitioners and communities connected to the collections.

Are there any potential risks of using AI in the cultural heritage sector?

Our main concerns have been around quality control and reproducibility. AI-generated results can vary, and at scale these challenges become even more complex. Having “humans in the loop”, including cataloguers and curators alongside academics, is essential in addressing this and for validating outputs. In practice, AI is rarely able to deliver a complete or definitive answer to complex research questions. It works best when questions are broken down into smaller tasks and guided by expert knowledge and targeted testing.

Another risk stems from AI’s reliance on digitised material. Most institutions have digitised only a fraction of their holdings, so results may be biased or unrepresentative if the quantity is too narrow. While ArCH has been able to digitise some additional material with support from ai@cam, this may not be the case for all institutions. There is also a danger that, when working with AI at scale, we overlook what is distinctive and irreplaceable about individual collections. AI is best viewed as a tool to enhance discovery and interpretation, rather than a replacement for direct engagement with original materials.

Finally, there are key environmental considerations. Training and running AI systems consumes significant energy, yet the GLAM sector currently lacks reliable tools for measuring these impacts. With sustainability becoming an increasing priority in galleries, libraries, archives, and museums, understanding and addressing the environmental footprint of AI is critical.
