This project explores how AI can streamline the administrative work of University committees, including minute-taking, drafting action lists, and summarising complex papers. Using secure and approved AI tools, the team will pilot AI support across a range of central and School committees. The project aims to reduce time spent on routine documentation while maintaining accuracy and confidentiality, freeing staff for higher-value work. Outputs will include practical guidance and recommendations to support wider adoption across the University.
