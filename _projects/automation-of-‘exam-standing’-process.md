Each year, staff manually check around 65,000 exam enrolments against complex programme rules, a time-intensive process that can cause delays and errors. Using natural language processing (NLP), the project will convert these rules into a machine readable “rules library” to automatically validate student selections and flag issues for review. The system will cut manual checking by over 90 percent and speed up exam administration while improving accuracy and consistency.
