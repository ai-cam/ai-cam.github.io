title: Automating Data Analysis with Large Language Model Agents
description: This project explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be
  harnessed to automate and optimise scientific research workflows, enabling
  discoveries to be made faster and more reliably than ever before. Leveraging
  custom multi-agent AI systems, the team builds intelligent research assistants
  that can plan, execute and check complex tasks — from data analysis and
  simulation to idea generation and manuscript drafting.

This project explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be harnessed to automate and optimise scientific research workflows, enabling discoveries to be made faster and more reliably than ever before. Leveraging custom *multi-agent AI systems*, the team builds intelligent research assistants that can plan, execute and check complex tasks — from data analysis and simulation to idea generation and manuscript drafting. 

This work extends beyond conventional LLM use by designing autonomous agents that collaborate like expert humans: assigning roles (e.g., idea generator, critic, engineer), breaking problems into manageable steps, and cross-verifying outputs. These agents have already demonstrated the ability to reproduce sophisticated cosmological data analyses in minutes rather than hours, a task previously requiring significant expert time. 

The project’s ambition is to make these capabilities widely accessible through a scalable, web-based platform that integrates personalised research environments powered by AI agents. This platform will empower researchers, including early-career scientists, to tackle data-intensive challenges by reducing routine tasks and freeing up cognitive effort for creative problem-solving.

By rethinking how AI can participate in the research process, this work aims to accelerate scientific discovery and democratise access to advanced analytical tools across domains such as physics, machine learning, biology, and medicine.
